# Painting-with-OpenCV
This program will create an augmented reality where you can paint. All the coding bits have been done on PyCharm
Make sure all the image files are added to your program, then you can start coding.

Make a separate file named "HandTrackingModule" which we will import later on into our main code. Put the code mentioned in the file into this module. 

Start a separate file that imports the HandTrackingModule into it. This is our PaintModule. This is the main code that enables us to paint in an Augmented Reality. The HandTrackingModule like the name says is only used to track the hand. Put the code mentioned in the file into the PaintModule.
